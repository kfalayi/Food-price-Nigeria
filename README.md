## Food price inflation in Nigeria

An analysis of food price index in Nigeria that looks at insecurity as a cause for food inflation

Nigeria has been facing consistent food inflation over the last few years as it fights insecurity in form of insurgency, gang activities and uptick in general social crimes. The purpose of this project is to find out what the data reveals about the impact of this insecurity on the current food price hike.

For this analysis, I depended on the data from Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics, which collects and publishes food price index every year. This has been consistent for more than 5 yyears but for this story, I used the food price index data from 2017, which is ![this file.](https://github.com/kfalayi/Food_price_Nigeria/blob/main/Nigfoodprices.xlsx)

Also, I used another dataset from the same agency which shows the average prices of the same food commodities listed in the previous dataset but this time, it shows the price in each state for December 2021 month. December was the most current price index available.
